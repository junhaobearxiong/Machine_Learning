1. Recognizing hand written digits. One can either do classfication i.e. supervised
learning, or clustering i.e. unsupervised learning. The data is available - MNIST.
Success in classfication can be measured by the proportion of digits classfied
correctly. Success in clustering can be measured by the proportion of digits in
the correct cluster.

Supervised learning
Pro: It is relatively easier to get good accuracy. There exist many algorithms
with guarantee for good performance. It is also generally more efficient. 
Con: Someone needs to hand label the training set. 

Unsupervised learning
Pro: No need to hand label data
Con: It is relatively harder to get good performance. It is generally slower.
Many good clustering algorithm e.g. :q


Supervised learning is more natural for this problem.
